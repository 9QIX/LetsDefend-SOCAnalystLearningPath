# SOC Types and Roles

## What is a SOC?

A Security Operation Center (SOC) is a facility where the information security team continuously monitors and analyzes the security of an organization. The primary purpose of the SOC team is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using technology, people, and processes.

## Types of SOC Models

Depending on your security needs and budget, there are several types of SOCs:

### In-house SOC

This team is formed when an organization builds its cybersecurity team. Organizations considering an internal SOC should have a budget to support its continuity.

### Virtual SOC

This type of SOC team does not have a permanent facility and often works remotely in various locations.

### Co-Managed SOC

The Co-Managed SOC consists of internal SOC staff working with an external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Coordination is key in this type of model.

### Command SOC

This SOC team oversees smaller SOCs across a large region. Organizations using this model include large telecommunications providers and defense agencies.

## People, Process, and Technology

Building a successful SOC requires serious coordination. Most importantly, there should be a strong relationship between people, processes, and technology. Simply put, we will discuss the people, processes, and technologies required for SOC.

### People

A strong SOC team requires highly trained personnel who are familiar with security alerts and attack scenarios. Because attack types are constantly changing, you need team members who can easily adapt to new attack types and are willing to conduct research.

### Processes

To further develop your SOC structure, you need to align it with many different types of security requirements, such as NIST, PCI, and HIPAA. All processes require extreme standardization of actions to ensure nothing is left out.

### Technology

The team needs to have different products for many tasks, such as penetration testing, detection, prevention, and analysis, and they need to follow the market and technology closely to find the best solution for the organization. Sometimes the best product on the market may not be the best product for your team. Remember to consider other factors such as the organization's budget.

## SOC Roles

### SOC Analyst

This role can be categorized as Level 1, 2, and 3 according to the SOC structure. A security analyst classifies the alert, looks for the cause, and advises on remediation.

### Incident Responder

An Incident Response Officer is an individual responsible for threat detection. This role performs the initial assessment of security breaches.

### Threat Hunter

A Threat Hunter is a cybersecurity professional who proactively seeks out and investigates potential threats and vulnerabilities within an organization's network or system. They use a combination of manual and automated techniques to detect, isolate, and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other sophisticated attacks that may evade traditional security measures. Threat hunters typically have a deep understanding of the organization's IT infrastructure and security posture, as well as knowledge of emerging threats and attack tactics. They aim to find and eliminate threats before they can damage or disrupt the business.

### Security Engineer

Security engineers are responsible for maintaining the security infrastructure of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions and security operations center (SOC) products. For example, a security engineer builds the connection between SIEM and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) products.

### SOC Manager

A SOC manager takes on management responsibilities such as budgeting, strategizing, managing staff, and coordinating operations. They deal with operational rather than technical issues.
