# SOC Analyst and Their Responsibilities

In this section, we will discuss what a SOC Analyst is, where they fit into the SOC team, and the general responsibilities of the role. It is important to review these sections carefully before learning about the technical side of the role. In this way, aspiring SOC Analyst candidates can get an idea of what their future career might look like.

## What is a SOC Analyst?

A SOC Analyst is the first person to investigate threats to a system. If the situation demands it, they escalate incidents to their supervisors so they can mitigate threats. The SOC Analyst plays an important role on the SOC team because they are the first person to respond to a threat.

## The Advantages of Being a SOC Analyst

There are many various techniques for attack vectors and malicious software, and they increase more and more every day. As an analyst, you will get greater enjoyment from investigating these varying types of incidents. Even though the operating systems, security products, etc., that you use will be the same, the job will feel less monotonous because you will be analyzing different incidents. Also, you may not encounter such techniques every week or every day.

## A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst

Throughout the day, a SOC analyst typically reviews alerts in the SIEM and determines which ones are real threats. To reach a conclusion, they use various security and protection products such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Log Management, and SOAR. We will explain in detail why and how these products are used later in the training program.

To be a successful SOC analyst who is not dependent on security products and can correctly analyze SIEM alerts, you must have the following skills and abilities:

### Operating Systems

To determine what is abnormal in a system, you first need to know what is accepted as normal. For example, there are many services within the Windows operating system, and it is difficult to know which ones are suspicious without knowing which ones are or could be considered normal Windows services. Therefore, you should be familiar with how Windows/Linux operating systems work.

### Network

First and foremost, in this role, you will be dealing with a lot of malicious IPs and URLs, so you need to confirm that there are no devices on the network trying to connect to those addresses. Once you accomplish that, it will set the direction of the analysis.

This step is a bit more complicated because you may have to find a potential data leak on the network. To perform all of these functions, you need to understand the basics of networking.

### Malware Analysis

When dealing with most threats, you are likely to encounter some type of malicious software. To understand the real purpose of these malicious programs (they sometimes display different behaviors to fool analysts), you need to have malware analysis skills.

It is important to at least determine what the command and control center of the malicious file is and whether or not there is a device communicating with that address.

In general, we have discussed what a SOC analyst is, what the responsibilities of the role are, and what skills a SOC Analyst needs to have. As the course progresses, it will also cover technical areas, starting with SIEM.
